          my GitHub Page</h3>        <p>This is my personal-professional page. I'm a developer in Chrome and          work mostly in video related topics, more concretely in <strong>WebRtc</strong>          <img  style="width: 19px; height: 19px;"  src="https://bitbucket-assetroot.s3.amazonaws.com/c/photos/2013/May/17/webrtc-codelab-logo-4294390350-1_avatar.png">related
          things. I have a mixed background in signal processing,          embedded/Real-Time systems, and basically all kinds of software          plumbings.</p>        <h3><span  style="color: rgb(240, 231, 213);">Life at Google, Chromium            and WebRtc</span></h3>        <p>I've spent the best part of three years now in those overlapping          places and, phew, it has been quite a ride. I started in Stockholm and          about half the way moved to Mountain View. I'm proud of a few things          I've done and less proud I didn't have the time or wasn't speedy          enough to get a few others done (this category is mostly related to          VP8/9 encoding/decoding and Zero Copy capture). Basically I divided my          life between doing Blink-related features and plumbing Video Capture          and the Real-Time video processing in Chrome in all platforms.</p>        <p>Blink-wise I'm quite happy with the<a  target="_blank"  href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/mediacapture-record/master/MediaRecorder.html"><span               style="color: rgb(240, 231, 213);">            </span>MediaStream Recording API</a> implementation. This was a long          standing effort ascribed to the WebRtc realms for the simple reason          that it records the Web Platform live media abstraction: MediaStream.          Quite notably, the <a  target="_blank"  href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=262211">original
            bug tracker</a> was the most starred ever in Chromium yet it had          been dangling with no one really having the time to commit to it. This          work was mostly concentrated in the second half of 2015. As a bonus, I          landed/am still landing the <a  target="_blank"  href="http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-fromelement/">stream

A few          notable things I've work in are e.g. <a  target="_blank"  href="http://crbug.com/288562"><span               style="color: rgb(240, 231, 213);"></span></a></p>        <ul>          <li><a  target="_blank"  href="http://crbug.com/288562"><span  style="color: rgb(240, 231, 213);"></span>landing
              the AVFoundation support for Mac capture and device monitoring</a>;            this was a humongous effort because Chrome ships a single binary for            Mac and AVFoundation had to be detected and loaded on runtime, which            gave way to tons of bugs and OS glitches.</li>          <li><a  target="_blank"  href="http://crbug.com/418052.">supporting              Android Camera 2.0</a>;</li>          <li><a  target="_blank"  href="http://crbug.com/309554">wiring the              Capture Device capabilities to the renderer</a>;</li>          <li><a  target="_blank"  href="http://crbug.com/357599">connecting              Flicker detection based on timezone</a>;</li>          <li><a  target="_blank"  href="https://crrev.com/151513006">supporting              the Tango 3D cameras</a>;</li>          <li><a  target="_blank"  href="http://opencv.org/opencv-ported-to-google-chrome-nacl-and-pnacl.html">porting

My previous employer was Alcatel-Lucent-Bell Labs          in Antwerpen, Belgium, same place were (mostly) the same guys          developed and shipped a bazillion DSL boxes giving service to a ton of          homes all around the world. In particular I worked in the DSL          aggregator IP (the whole thing is marketed as <a  target="_blank"  href="https://www.alcatel-lucent.com/products/7360-isam-fx">ISAM</a>)          which is the secret sauce of where all DSL or PON customer lines get          bundled into a massive chunk of uplinks of about ~500GBps (usually          splitted into a number of 10/40 or even 100GB ethernet over fiber).          ALu is a great place to do network equipment and, well, not too good a          place for anything else.</p>        <p>Also in Belgium (with trips to Noordwijk in the Netherlands) I worked          for this contractor of the European Space Agency that got me to deal          with two systems; one was a <a  target="_blank"  href="http://www.spaceapplications.com/products/neuroscience/view">VR
            for astronaut experiments</a>, measuring the response time to          different audiovisual stimuli, where I did the real time parts          (basically a pace maker sucking managing FIFOs for sensor inputs and          actuator outputs, all using RTX for Win - sig).&nbsp; The other          project was an <a  target="_blank"  href="https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/doc/EVENTS/bmiworkshop/ACT-PRE-BNG-WEAR%28BMI_Workshop%29.pdf">attitude
            and heading tracking to support astronauts onboard the ISS</a> (this          one eventually <a  target="_blank"  href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Augmented_reality_to_help_astronauts_make_sense_of_space">made
            it up there</a>!); in here I did the Kalman filter formulation for          all sensor integration (those days accelerometers and gyros were not          integrated and was quite a challenge to solder them, let alone model          it).</p>        <p>Immediately before that I worked in Spain for a few years in Real          Time Linux systems for trains, more concretely for train-ground          communication and a bit on train controllers. That was a ton of fun,          dealing with those tiny RTAIs (later Xenomais) bridging GRPS and GSMR          to the MVB (a Real-Time serial bus on the train from where all systems          hang, including engines and brakes!). Moreover it's heart warming to          see those systems in operation all around the world carrying tiny          pieces of me :)</p>        <p>Even before that I finished a M.Sc. in CompSci in UCD (Ireland) on          power consumption estimation for software running on embedded devices,          which was a quite interesting research that lead to a few publications          here and there. </p>        <h4><span  style="color: rgb(240, 231, 213);">GitHub life</span></h4>        <p>What do I have in GitHub?
